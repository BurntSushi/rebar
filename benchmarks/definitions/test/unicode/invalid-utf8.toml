These benchmarks test the support (or not) of invalid UTF-8 in the regex
engine. These tests tend to exclude regex engines that only work on Unicode
strings, where "Unicode string" is something like "a valid sequence of code
units" (in its encoded form) or "a valid sequence of Unicode codepoints" (in
its decoded form). If a regex engine only works on Unicode strings, then it, by
definition, cannot accept invalid UTF-8.

Some regex engines can run on invalid UTF-8. Usually this just means invalid
UTF-8 is treated as if it were `U+FFFD` (the Unicode replacement codepoint), or
they're matched as their raw bytes which typically don't match most constructs.

Note that we don't test other cases like invalid UTF-16. While I don't know for
certain, for example, I believe .NET's regex engine can search any arbitrary
sequence of `Char` values, which in turn corresponds to any sequence of
unsigned 16-bit integers. We don't test this because rebar generally works with
UTF-8 (or rather, arbitrary byte sequences), and it is up to the runner program
to convert this into a format that can be searched by the regex engine. So in
order to test invalid UTF-16, we'd either have to natively support UTF-16 or
use some kind of encoding scheme (like WTF-8) that permits us to represent
invalid UTF-16 losslessly in what is typically a UTF-8 sequence.

These benchmarks aren't really intended to be used for collecting timing
measurements. These are just about verifying functionality.

N.B. The `pile-of-poo-prefix.txt` haystack consists of the bytes
`\xF0\x9F\x92`, which corresponds to a valid prefix of 💩. A regex engine
that works by matching one codepoint at a time could _lossily_ decode this as
one single `U+FFFD` (replacement) corresponding to a single valid prefix of
a valid codepoing (this is known as "substitution of maximal subparts"). It
could also choose to decode it as three distinct `U+FFFD` codepoints, each one
corresponding to a byte in the valid prefix. `go/regexp` is an example of a
regex engine that does the latter. (RE2 does not, really, because it matches
one byte at a time, like the Rust regex engine.)
