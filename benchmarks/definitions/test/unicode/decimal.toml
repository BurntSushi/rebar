These benchmarks test the functionality of `\d`. A `\d` is generally either
equivalent to `[0-9]`, or it's equivalent to the definition offered
in [UTS#18][uts18]. UTS#18 defines it as `\p{gc=Decimal_Number}`.

Where regex engines differ is the extent to which this can be toggled. Some
regex engines support both definitions. Some support *only* the ASCII variant
and some support *only* the Unicode variant. Unlike `\w` and `\s`, it is
sometimes the case that regex engines with otherwise decent Unicode support
will actually still fix `\d` to `[0-9]`, likely because it's *usually* what you
want. Otherwise, things like `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}` end up matching a lot more
than a simple date.

These benchmarks aren't really intended to be used for collecting timing
measurements. These are just about verifying functionality.
