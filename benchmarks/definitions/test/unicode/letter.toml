These benchmarks test the support of the `Letter` Unicode general category
alias. It is an alias for the union of the `Uppercase_Letter` (`Lu`),
`Lowercase_Letter` (`Ll`), `Titlecase_Letter` (`Lt`), `Modifier_Letter` (`Lm`)
and `Other_Letter` (`Lo`) general categories.

Basically, almost all regex engines these days support something like `\pL`.
But regex engines differ in the way one can syntactically represent `\pL`. It's
kind of all over the place. [UTS#18][utf18] technically covers what should be
supported, but not all regex engines comply. (And some even very intentionally
do not comply, for example, ECMAScript.)

These benchmarks aren't really intended to be used for collecting timing
measurements. These are just about verifying functionality.

N.B. This matches a Greek delta that is within the BMP. The test below matches
a different variant of a Greek delta that is *outside* the BMP. Why distinguish
these? Because it matters for some regex engines!

probably a known and `wontfix` bug I imagine? See the note below.

N.B. This is a particularly interesting case for regex engines that are based
on UTF-16, because it exposes whether they treat UTF-16 code units as the
fundamental atom of matching, or if they treat codepoints as the atom of
matching. For proper Unicode support, you really want the latter. (Of course,
some regex engines permit toggling what is the fundamental atom of matching,
but I don't believe .NET does.) Since it looks like .NET uses UTF-16 code
units as the atom of matching, and since character classes generally can only
match one atom, it follows that .NET can't match codepoints outside the BMP
with a character class because such codepoints consist of surrogate pairs.
Interestingly, Java handles this case correctly, despite also representing a
`char` as a single UTF-16 code unit.
