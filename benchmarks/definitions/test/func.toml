analysis = '''
These benchmarks test various pieces of functionality of regex engines. If a
regex engine *isn't* in a particular benchmark, then it should be assumed that
it fails in some way.

We leave out testing Unicode functionality since it represents a huge can of
worms. See the `unicode` directory for a whole suite of tests.

These benchmarks aren't really intended to be used for collecting timing
measurements. These are just about verifying functionality.

# N.B. We don't currently have any engines in rebar with exclusively

`hyperscan` isn't included here since it reports all possible matches. So it
matches both `sam` and `samwise` here.

Some regex engines permit `$` to match *both* at the end of a haystack and
immediately after `\n` when `\n` is the last character in the haystack. Note
that this is *without* enabling multi-line mode. If multi-line mode were
enabled, then all regex engines would match this haystack 3 times.
