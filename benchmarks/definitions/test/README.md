This directory contains tests masquerading as benchmark definitions. That is,
the benchmarks in this directory are not used for gathering measurements, but
for checking what regex engines and the rebar runner programs actually support.

This is not meant to be a completely exhaustive set of tests for support, but
more are definitely welcome if you find a *big* gap. A real regex test suite
will usually have a lot more stuff than what is here, but this serves as a way
of approximating and actually seeing some of the differences between regex
engines.
