analysis = '''
These benchmarks are meant to test that each benchmark model passes a basic
check for a particular regex engine. These don't exhaustively test every nook
and cranny of each model. It does include basic things like ensuring span
counts are correct and that `\r` and `\n` are treated as line terminators in
the `grep` and `grep-captures` models.

These benchmarks aren't really intended to be used for collecting timing
measurements.

This benchmark is a way to test the most basic capabilities of probably almost
any regex engine worth benchmarking, and does so via the `count` model. It
doesn't even use a bounded repetition operator. Just a simple manual repetition
with exactly one possible match.
