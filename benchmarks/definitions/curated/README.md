This directory contains a selection of "curated" benchmark definitions. These
make up a fairly small subset of the benchmarks defined in this repository,
but are meant to serve as an approximate representative sample that covers a
broad range of regex use cases. These are the same benchmarks whose results are
presented in the README.
