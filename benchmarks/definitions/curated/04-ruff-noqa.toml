The regex benchmarked here comes from the [Ruff project][ruff], which is a
Python linter written in Rust. The project uses many regexes, but [we pluck
one out in particular][noqa] that is likely to be run more frequently than the
others:

```
(\s*)((?i:# noqa)(?::\s?(([A-Z]+[0-9]+(?:[,\s]+)?)+))?)
```

This is a regex that looks for `# noqa` annotations on each line. The `noqa`
annotation generally causes the linter to ignore those lines with respect to
warnings it emits. The regex also tries to extract annotations following the
`noqa` that permit ignoring only specific rules in the linter.

This benchmark has a few interesting characteristics worth pointing out:

* It is line oriented, which means the haystacks it searches are likely to be
small. This in turn means that the overhead of the regex engine is likely to
matter more than in throughput oriented benchmarks.
* On this particular haystack (the CPython source code), the number of matches
is quite small. Therefore, it is quite beneficial here to be able to have a
fast path to say "there is no match" without doing any extra work. While the
number of matches here is perhaps uncharacteristically small for a Python
project, you would generally expect _most_ lines to not have `# noqa` in them,
and so the presumption of a fast rejection is probably a decent assumption for
this particular regex.
* Ruff uses capturing groups to pick out parts of the match, so when a match
is found, the regex engine needs to report additional information beyond just
the overall match spans. The spans of each matching capture group also need
to be reported.
* There are no prefix (or suffix) literals in the regex to enable any
straight-forward prefilter optimizations.

With respect to the point about no prefix or suffix literals, we also include
a tweaked version of the regex that removes the leading `(\s*)`:

```
(?i:# noqa)(?::\s?(([A-Z]+[0-9]+(?:[,\s]+)?)+))?
```

In this case, the regex now starts with a literal, albeit one that is asked
to match case insensitively. We can actually see pretty clearly the impact
the tweaked version has on the speed for each regex engine. `pcre2/jit`, for
example, improves its throughput from around 500 MB/s to 1.5 GB/s. `go/regexp`
has an even more dramatic (relatively speaking) improvement.

`rust/regex` is a little different in that it's quite fast in both cases.
The key optimization that applies for `rust/regex` is the "reverse inner"
optimization. Even in the original regex, `rust/regex` will pluck out the `#
noqa` literal and search for it case insensitively. When a candidate is found,
it then searches for `(\s*)` in reverse to find the start position, and then
finally does a standard forward search from that point to find the reverse
position.
