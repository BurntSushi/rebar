These benchmarks demonstrate the prefix prefilter optimization. This is
the most "basic" of literal optimizations in that it looks for prefixes
that occur in every match of a regex, and then looks for occurrences of
those prefixes in the haystack. Occurrences are considered candidate matches
and must be confirmed by the regex engine. Upon failure, the prefilter is
usually restarted to look for more candidates. In general, this results is
significant (sometimes by orders of magnitude) speed improvements in many
cases. It can sometimes lead to slower searches if the false positive rate
of candidate matches is high. (For those, see the `folly` benchmarks in the
parent directory.)

Despite the seeming simplicity of this optimization, regex engines vary
in their sophistication. Some just look for a single byte prefix and use
memchr in that case, and then otherwise don't do much. The regex crate tries
quite hard to extract prefixes and has a couple different SIMD algorithms it
can employ, including for handling cases where there are multiple distinct
prefixes.

The trick is generally knowing when to stop. For example, you could generate
52 different prefixes all ending with `foo` for `[A-Za-z]foo\w+`, but that's
unlikely to be effective because as you increase the number of prefixes you
look for, you 1) generally do so at a slower speed and 2) risk the chance of
increasing your false positive rate.

Still... You don't necessarily want to find the fewest prefixes either. For
example, given something like `foo[a-c]`, you might actually want to look for
`{fooa, foob, fooc}`, as that set is still fairly small and might lead to a
lower false positive rate than just `foo`.

And still yet, you also want to generally prefer longer prefixes if you can.
For example, given `Sherlock|Holmes`, you might be tempted to just look for
occurrences of `S` and `H`. But if they are frequent in your haystack, that
might lead to a substantially higher false positive rate than just looking
for `{Sherlock, Holmes}`.

In other words, this is basically a dark art and is really just a whole pile
of heuristics that seem to work well empirically.

This measures a non-ASCII literal on a non-ASCII haystack. Regex engines that
naively just feed the first byte to memchr get wrecked on this benchmark by a
high false positive rate, because they wind up using a UTF-8 leading byte that
occurs in almost every codepoint in the haystack.

This is a mostly silly little benchmark that looks for a couple different
functions. This mostly checks whether regex engines do a literal scan for both
`fn is_` and `fn as_`, or just `fn `. (One doesn't seem obviously better than
the other. The former will have a lower false positive rate, but the latter is
likely to be much quicker at identifying candidates, depending on algorithm
choice.)
