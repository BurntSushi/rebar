These benchmarks test an optimization only present in full DFAs where some
states get "accelerated." Namely, this happens when a state has only a few
transitions that leave the state and where all other transitions point back to
the same state. When this happens, fast vectorized routines like `memchr` can
be used to look for just the outgoing transitions because otherwise the search
will just stay in the same state.

This optimization only applies when full DFAs are used because it requires
knowing ahead of the time the full set of transitions for a state. Since things
like the lazy DFA compute their transitions lazily, this technique can't
(easily) be applied there. Since building full DFAs is extremely expensive, it
is only done for very small regexes. Therefore, this optimization is somewhat
limited in scope.

This just tries to match an entire line with line anchors. The DFA sees that
`.` can't match `\n` but otherwise will match everything. So the DFA will pass
`\n` to `memchr` to quickly find the end of the line.

This regex was taken from the `regex-redux` benchmark. It is used at the
beginning of that benchmark to remove all line terminators and lines beginning
with `>`. The result is a flattened string of nucleotides.

The DFA is able to accelerate the `[^\n]*\n` construction by feeding `\n` and
`>` to `memchr2`. It does the same for the reverse DFA. Why `>`? Well, this is
an unanchored regex, so if the regex stumbles on a `>`, then that could start a
new match. So that transitions to some other state in the DFA.
