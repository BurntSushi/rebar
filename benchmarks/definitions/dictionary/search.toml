analysis = '''
These benchmarks attempt to search for occurrences of words in varying
dictionary sizes. Engines like PCRE2 can't handle any of these. Some
backtrackers, like python/re and regress, can at least execute some of the
smaller dictionaries but they are quite slow. The regex crate generally does
pretty well as it has a specific optimization for large literal alternations:
it just diverts to Aho-Corasick.
