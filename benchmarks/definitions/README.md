This directory contains benchmark definitions in TOML format. For a description
of the format, see [FORMAT.md](../../FORMAT.md).

Note that if you're looking for the definitions of benchmarks presented in the
README, then they are in the [curated](curated) directory. There are _many_
other benchmarks in this repository, but they are mostly used to facilitate
performance improvements in [Rust's regex crate][rust-regex] or other more
exploratory analysis.
