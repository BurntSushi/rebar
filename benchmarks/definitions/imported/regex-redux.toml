This is a port of the [Benchmark Game's regex-redux
benchmark][benchgame-regexredux]. It is not precisely equivalent because it
bans things like parallelism and ensures all regex engines use as similar
configuration as possible. (For example, disabling Unicode mode in any regex
engine that enables it by default, since this benchmark is purely ASCII.)

See the [MODELS](MODELS.md) document in the repo root for a more in depth
description of the regex-redux model. Namely, this particular benchmark is
different from the rest in that it is more complicated than "search a regex in
some haystack repeatedly."
