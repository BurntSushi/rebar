# This is a port of the Benchmark Game's regex-redux benchmark. It is not
# precisely equivalent because it bans things like parallelism and ensures
# all regex engines use as similar configuration as possible. (For example,
# disabling Unicode mode in any regex engine that enables it by default, since
# this benchmark is purely ASCII.)
#
# See the MODELS.md document in the repo root for a more in depth description
# of the regex-redux model. Namely, this particular benchmark is different from
# the rest in that it is more complicated than "search a regex in some haystack
# repeatedly."
