These benchmarks demonstrate the folly of literal optimizations. Basically,
literal optimizations are a classic case of selling out some cases in
exchange for making some other (typically more common) cases exceptionally
fast. But when you hit the cases where the literal optimizations break down,
perf can be slower than if you didn't attempt the literal optimizations at
all. Typically, the way to trash perf is to increase the false positive rate
of detecting candidates via literal matches. This in turn causes a ping-pong
effect: a candidate is found via a fast substring (or multi-substring)
search, but it fails to lead to an overall match, so then you go back to the
substring search and repeat this ping-ponging between the regex engine and
the literal search. The overhead of this can add up to quite a bit with a
very high false positive rate.

The main purpose of these benchmarks is to demonstrate these cases, shine
some light on them and hopefully work toward making them "not too bad."

This one causes the Rust regex engine to look for matches of `awyer|inn`,
then do a reverse search for '[A-Z]' which fails. Then it restarts the search
for 'awyer|inn' again only to find another candidate match immediately that
doesn't lead to an overall match. And so on.

Note that [A-Z] was chosen specifically here. If you use [A-Za-z], then the
backwards search will overlap with a previous candidate match, which in turn
causes it to detect potential quadratic behavior almost immediately. At that
point, it gives up the "reverse inner" strategy and falls back to a normal
DFA forward scan, which has respectable speed.

This benchmark is a good example of how even the most basic literal
optimizations can vary across regex engines. Here, the 're2' and 'go/regexp'
engines do quite well in part because their literal optimizations aren't
terribly sophisticated. I *believe* in this case they work by feeding the
first byte of the pattern to memchr to find candidate matches and then using
the regex engine to confirm or reject. Since 'Z' occurs quite rarely in the
haystack, most of the search stays in the very hot memchr loop.

Contrast this to the regex crate which uses a SIMD substring search instead
of memchr. It still performs admirably, but at around half the speed.

You might read the description for 'literal-never-match-rare' above and
think, "okay so some regex engines aren't sophisticated but at least they
get predictable and consistent performance." Not so! In this benchmark, we
also search for a literal that never matches, but the bytes that make up
the literal are overall much more frequently occurring than in the above
benchmark.

In this case, `re2` and `go/regexp` still do just fine (hovering at just above
3 GB/s, versus 80 GB/s for 'literal-never-match-rare'), but the regex crate
maintains identical performance as above at around 49 GB/s. This is because its
SIMD substring search, while making use of frequency heuristics, is more robust
in the face of frequently occurring bytes.

This benchmark is an attempt to make the regex crate's uses of memmem slow
down. We have to carefully construct the needle to contain some rare bytes that
we know the SIMD algorithm will hone in on. In this case, that's Y and Z. The
inner SIMD loop will look for places where not only those two bytes match, but
match at a distance that is equal to their distance in the needle. Thus, we
may sure our haystack has a lot of those two bytes occurring at that distance.
*But*, we also make sure to change one *other* byte from the needle to ensure
that the overall match fails.

In effect, this causes the SIMD algorithm to constantly ping-pong in and
out of its inner loop where it finds a candidate and causes it to do its
confirmation step. (Which, for a needle this small, is just memcmp.) The
confirmation then fails and the whole process repeats itself.

If you're having trouble groking this, you might consider perusing the
memchr crate's memmem submodule, which has lots of comments for how it
works. The algorithm is also [described at a high level by Wojciech
Muła][0x80-simd-strfind], although that description doesn't account for the
frequency based heuristics that `memchr::memmem` uses, and are in particular
relevant to this benchmark.

This does cause the memmem search to slow down by about a factor of 4. Other
regex engines also seem to slow down. Do note that this depends on where we
put the mismatch! For example, if we repeated 'aooYbarZquux' in our haystack,
then RE2's search will be extremely fast because it will give 'f' (the first
byte in the needle) to memchr, and since 'f' doesn't occur at all until the
match at the end of the haystack, its false positive rate is zero.
