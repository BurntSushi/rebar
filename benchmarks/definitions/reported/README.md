This directory contains benchmarks derived in part or in whole from issues
reported to the regex crate in some way. Each benchmark *should* be connected
to one or more issues. The naming convention should roughly match the following
regex: `[ipd][0-9]+-\S+`, where `i` stands for "issue," `p` stands for "pull
request" and `d` stands for "discussion." The trailing `\S+` is meant to be a
short human readable name for the benchmark.
