# This file defines all of the regex engines that 'rebar' knows how to run. In
# all cases, regex engines are executed over a sub-process boundary.
#
# While a sub-process boundary is not actually necessary to benchmark many
# regex engines (for example, it could be done in-process via a C API), we
# still use a sub-process boundary in all cases to ensure our methodology
# remains invariant with respect to other regex engines. The communication at
# the process boundary is designed such that sub-process overhead plays no role
# in the measurements.
#
# The reason for using a sub-process boundary at all is because many regex
# engines cannot be or cannot easily be exposed via a C API. Thus, rebar uses
# the lowest possible common denominator: the process boundary. That is,
# probably every regex engine that could ever be worth benchmarking should be
# able to be exposed via some kind of process.
#
# The format for this file is defined at FORMAT.md#engine-toml-format. Although
# it's likely enough to just look at existing examples if you want to add a new
# engine.

# The venerable Hyperscan regex engine. Notable for its best-in-class literal
# optimizations, support for stream searching and excellent support for
# searching for many regexes at once with good scaling properties. Its main
# quirks are that it struggles with finding the start of a match and always
# reports the position of every match instead of the leftmost-first or
# leftmost-longest match.
#
# Sadly, it looks like Hyperscan might be a dead (or nearly dead) project. We
# should consider switching (or just adding) Vectorscan...
#
# URL: https://github.com/intel/hyperscan
#
# Note that we currently use a third party Rust binding to Hyperscan. I
# generally tried to avoid these for other engines (like RE2 and PCRE2), but
# I ran out of steam. Hyperscan's API is a bit more complicated to wrap and
# its build is also more complex. I did briefly audit the binding library and
# things look reasonableish. (But not the 'regex' API wrapper. It allocates new
# scratch space for every search. Definitely do not use that ever.)

# RUST REGEX CRATE INTERNAL REGEX ENGINES
#
# These reflect different regex engines used by 'rust/regex' internally, and
# are split out here to aide in the development of 'rust/regex' itself by
# comparing the perf of different regex engines directly. These generally help
# inform heuristics for knowing when to use one regex engine over the other.
# (Heuristics are not the only mechanism for deciding which engine to use, but
# they play a part. For example, some regex engines like the one-pass DFA can
# only run a relatively small subset of all regexes.)

# a one-pass DFA, a lazy DFA, a full DFA, Aho-Corasick, Teddy and memmem.
#
# The "meta" regex engine is nearly equivalent to the 'rust/regex' engine,
# as the latter is "just" a light wrapper over the meta engine. The meta
# engine principally exposes a lower level API and doesn't do any internal
