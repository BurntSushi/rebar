This directory contains recorded measurements for curated benchmarks only.
Currently, there is no schedule for which these are recorded. It is done on an
ad hoc basis.

Each subdirectory corresponds to the date at which the measurements were
recorded. Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` with a complete report of
all results summarized in a Markdown format. Each subdirectory also contains
files with information about the CPU used to record the measurements.

See the [TUTORIAL](../../TUTORIAL.md) for a guide on how to explore a large set
of measurements using `rebar`.
