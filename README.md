## Results

This section shows the results of a _curated and [biased](BIAS.md)_ set of
benchmarks. These reflect only a small subset of the benchmarks defined in
this repository, but were carefully crafted to attempt to represent a broad
range of use cases and annotated where possible with analysis to aide in the
interpretation of results.

The results begin with a summary, then a list of links to each benchmark group
and then finally the results for each group. Results are shown one benchmark
group at a time, where a single group is meant to combine related regexes or
workloads, where it is intended to be useful to see how results change across
regex engines. Analysis is provided, at minimum, for every group. Although,
analysis is heavily biased towards Rust's regex crate, as it is what this
author knows best. However, contributions that discuss other regex engines are
very welcomed.

Below each group of results are the parameters for each individual benchmark
within that group. An individual benchmark may contain some analysis specific
to it, but it will at least contain a summary of the benchmark details. Some
parameters, such as the haystack, are usually too big to show in this README.
One can use rebar to look at the haystack directly. Just take the `full name`
of the benchmark and give it to the `rebar haystack` command. For example:

```
$ rebar haystack unicode/compile/fifty-letters
ͱͳͷΐάέήίΰαβγδεζηθικλμνξοπρςστυφχψωϊϋόύώϙϛϝϟϡϸϻͱͳͷΐάέή
```

Similarly, the full benchmark execution details (including the haystack) can
be seen with the `rebar klv` command:

```
$ rebar klv unicode/compile/fifty-letters
name:29:unicode/compile/fifty-letters
model:7:compile
pattern:7:\pL{50}
case-insensitive:5:false
unicode:4:true
haystack:106:ͱͳͷΐάέήίΰαβγδεζηθικλμνξοπρςστυφχψωϊϋόύώϙϛϝϟϡϸϻͱͳͷΐάέή
max-iters:1:0
max-warmup-iters:1:0
max-time:1:0
max-warmup-time:1:0
```

Finally, you can run the benchmark yourself and look at results on the command
line:

```
$ rebar measure -f '^unicode/compile/fifty-letters$' | tee results.csv
$ rebar cmp results.csv
```

### Summary

Below are two tables summarizing the results of regex engines benchmarked.
Each regex engine includes its version at the time measurements were captured,
a summary score that ranks it relative to other regex engines across all
benchmarks and the total number of measurements collected.

The first table ranks regex engines based on search time. The second table
ranks regex engines based on compile time.

The summary statistic used is the [geometric mean] of the speed ratios for
each regex engine across all benchmarks that include it. The ratios within
each benchmark are computed from the median of all timing samples taken, and
dividing it by the best median of the regex engines that participated in the
benchmark. For example, given two regex engines `A` and `B` with results `35
ns` and `25 ns` on a single benchmark, `A` has a speed ratio of `1.4` and
`B` has a speed ratio of `1.0`. The geometric mean reported here is then the
"average" speed ratio for that regex engine across all benchmarks.

Each regex engine is linked to the directory containing the runner program
responsible for compiling a regex, using it in a search and reporting timing
results. Each directory contains a `README` file briefly describing any engine
specific details for the runner program.

Each regex engine is also defined in
[benchmarks/engines.toml](benchmarks/engines.toml), using the same name listed
in the table below. Each definition includes instructions for how to run,
build, clean and obtain the version of each regex engine.

**Caution**: Using a single number to describe the overall performance of a
regex engine is a fraught endeavor, and it is debatable whether it should be
included here at all. It is included primarily because the number of benchmarks
is quite large and overwhelming. It can be quite difficult to get a general
sense of things without a summary statistic. In particular, a summary statistic
is also useful to observe how the _overall picture_ itself changes as changes
are made to the barometer. (Whether it be by adding new regex engines or
adding/removing/changing existing benchmarks.) One particular word of caution
is that while geometric mean is more robust with respect to outliers than
arithmetic mean, it is not unaffected by them. Therefore, it is still critical
to examine individual benchmarks if one wants to better understanding the
performance profile of any specific regex engine or workload.

### Benchmark Groups

Below is a list of links to each benchmark group in this particular barometer.
Each benchmark group contains 1 or more related benchmarks. The idea of each
group is to tell some kind of story about related workloads, and to give
a sense of how performance changes based on the variations between each
benchmark.

### literal

This group of benchmarks measures regex patterns that are simple literals. When
possible, we also measure case insensitive versions of the same pattern. We do
this across three languages: English, Russian and Chinese. For English, Unicode
mode is disabled while it is enabled for Russian and Chinese. (Which mostly
only matters for the case insensitive benchmarks.)

This group is mainly meant to demonstrate two things. Firstly is whether the
regex engine does some of the most basic forms of optimization by recognizing
that a pattern is just a literal, and that a full blown regex engine is
probably not needed. Indeed, naively using a regex engine for this case is
likely to produce measurements much worse than most regex engines. Secondly is
how the performance of simple literal searches changes with respect to both
case insensitivity and Unicode. Namely, substring search algorithms that work
well on ASCII text don't necessarily also work well on UTF-8 that contains many
non-ASCII codepoints. This is especially true for case insensitive searches.

Notice, for example, how RE2 seems to be faster in the `sherlock-casei-ru`
benchmark than in the `sherlock-ru` benchmark, even though the latter is "just"
a simple substring search where as the former is a multiple substring search.
In the case of `sherlock-ru`, RE2 actually attempts a literal optimization that
likely gets caught up in dealing with a high false positive rate of candidates.
Where as in the case of `sherlock-casei-ru`, no literal optimization is
attempted and instead its lazy DFA is used. The high false positive rate in the
simpler literal case winds up making it overall slower than it likely would be
if it would just use the DFA.

This is not in any way to pick on RE2. Every regex engine that does literal
optimizations (and most do) will suffer from this kind of setback in one way
or another.

### literal-alternate

This group is like `literal`, but expands the complexity from a simple literal
to a small alternation of simple literals, including case insensitive variants
where applicable. Once again, we do this across three languages: English,
Russian and Chinese. We disable Unicode mode for English but enable it for
Russian and Chinese. Enabling Unicode here generally only means that case
insensitivity takes Unicode case folding rules into account.

This benchmark ups the ante when it comes to literal optimizations. Namely,
for a regex engine to optimize this case, it generally needs to be capable of
reasoning about literal optimizations that require one or more literals from
a set to match. Many regex engines don't deal with this case well, or at all.
For example, after a quick scan at comparing the `sherlock-en` benchmark here
and in the previous `literal` group, one thing that should stand out is the
proportion of regex engines that now measure throughput in MB/s instead of
GB/s.

One of the difficulties in optimizing for this case is that multiple substring
search is difficult to do in a way that is fast. In particular, this benchmark
carefully selected each alternation literal to start with a different character
than the other alternation literals. This, for example, inhibits clever regex
engines from noticing that all literals begin with the same byte (or small
number of bytes). Consider an alternation like `foo|far|fight`. It is not hard
to see that a regex engine _could_ just scan for the letter `f` as a prefilter
optimization. Here, we pick our regex such that this sort of shortcut isn't
available. For the regex engine to optimize this case, it really needs to deal
with the problem of multiple substring search.

Multiple substring search _can_ be implemented via a DFA, and perhaps in some
cases, quite quickly via a [shift DFA]. Beyond that though, multiple substring
search can be implemented by other various algorithms such as Aho-Corasick or
Rabin-Karp. (The standard Aho-Corasick formulation is an NFA, but it can also
be converted to a DFA by pre-computing all failure transitions. This winds up
with a similar result as using Thompson's construction to produce an NFA and
then powerset construction to get a DFA, but the Aho-Corasick construction
algorithm is usually quite a bit faster because it doesn't need to deal with a
full NFA.)

The problem here is that DFA speeds may or may not help you. For example, in
the case of RE2 and Rust's regex engine, it will already get DFA speeds by
virtue of their lazy DFAs. Indeed, in this group, RE2 performs roughly the same
across all benchmarks. So even if you, say build an Aho-Corasick DFA, it's not
going to help much if at all. So it makes sense to avoid it.

But Rust's regex crate has quite a bit higher throughputs than RE2 on most of
the benchmarks in this group. So how is it done? Currently, this is done via
the [Teddy] algorithm, which was ported out of [Hyperscan]. It is an algorithm
that makes use of SIMD to accelerate searching for a somewhat small set of
literals. Most regex engines don't have this sort of optimization, and indeed,
it seems like Teddy is not particularly well known. Alas, regex engines that
want to move past typical DFA speeds for multiple substring search likely need
some kind of vectorized algorithm to do so. (Teddy is also used by Rust's
regex crate in the previous `literal` group of benchmarks for accelerating
case insensitive searches. Namely, it enumerates some finite set of prefixes
like `she`, `SHE`, `ShE` and so on, and then looks for matches of those as a
prefilter.)

### date

This is a monster regex for extracting dates from unstructured text from
the [datefinder] project written in Python. The regex itself was taken from
[printing the `DATES_PATTERN`][datefinder-regex] variable in the `datefinder`
project. I then removed all names from the capture groups, unnecessary escapes
and collapsed it to a single line (because not all regex engines support
verbose mode).

The regex is more akin to a tokenizer, and the `datefinder` library attempts to
combine these tokens into timestamps.

We measure an ASCII only version of it and a Unicode-aware version of it.
Unicode is relevant here because of case insensitivity, and because the regex
makes use of the character classes `\s` and `\d`, which are bigger when they're
Unicode aware. We also measure the compilation time of each.

The results here can be a little tricky to interpret. Namely, it looks like
backtrackers tend to do worse than automata oriented regex engines, but
`go/regexp` uses automata and is itself quite slow here. Notice, though, that
`hyperscan`, `re2` and `rust/regex` do well here. While I'm less familiar with
`hyperscan`, the explanation for `re2` and `rust/regex` is obvious once you
look at a profile: it's the lazy DFA. Both have implementations of a regex
engine that build a DFA during search time, with at most one new transition
(and one new state) being create per byte of haystack. In practice, most
transitions get reused, which means that it tends to act like a real DFA most
of the time for most regexes on most haystacks.

Compilation time of this monster regex is also all over the place. PCRE2 does
the best, and Hyperscan winds up being quite slow. Once you enable Unicode
mode, compilation time generally gets worse, and especially so for `re2` and
`rust/regex`. In particular, both compile _byte oriented_ automata, which means
the transitions are defined over bytes and not codepoints. That means large
Unicode classes like `\d` tend to balloon in size, because they get converted
into UTF-8 automata.

**ascii**

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| full name | `curated/03-date/ascii` |
| model | [`count-spans`](MODELS.md#count-spans) |
| regex-path | [`wild/date.txt`](benchmarks/regexes/wild/date.txt) |
| case-insensitive | `true` |
| unicode | `false` |
| haystack-path | [`rust-src-tools-3b0d4813.txt`](benchmarks/haystacks/rust-src-tools-3b0d4813.txt) |
| count(`dotnet.*`) | 111825 |

| count(`icu`) | 111825 |
| count(`javascript/v8`) | 111825 |
| count(`regress`) | 111841 |
| count(`.*`) | 111817 |

As with many other benchmarks, Hyperscan reports all matches, even ones that
are overlapping. This particular regex is too big to analyze closely, but it
seems plausible one could still use it (possibly with a slightly tweaked regex)
for this task.

**unicode**

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| full name | `curated/03-date/unicode` |
| model | [`count-spans`](MODELS.md#count-spans) |
| regex-path | [`wild/date.txt`](benchmarks/regexes/wild/date.txt) |
| case-insensitive | `true` |
| unicode | `true` |
| haystack-path | [`rust-src-tools-3b0d4813.txt`](benchmarks/haystacks/rust-src-tools-3b0d4813.txt) |
| count(`dotnet/compiled|icu|java/hotspot|javascript/v8`) | 111825 |
| count(`.*`) | 111841 |

`regress` is included here despite its `\d` not being Unicode-aware (as
required by ECMAScript). Notably, its `\s` _is_ Unicode aware. (`\w` is too,
but it's not used in this regex.) In this particular haystack, `\d` being
ASCII-only doesn't impact the match count.

However, neither `re2` nor `go/regexp` are included here because neither `\d`
nor `\s` are Unicode-aware, and the `\s` being ASCII-only does impact the match
count.

`hyperscan` is excluded here because the pattern results in a "too large"
compilation error. As far as I know, Hyperscan doesn't expose any knobs for
increasing this limit.

`dotnet/compiled` gets a different count here, but it's not clear why.

`perl` is left out of this benchmark because it times out.

**compile-ascii**

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| full name | `curated/03-date/compile-ascii` |
| model | [`compile`](MODELS.md#compile) |
| regex-path | [`wild/date.txt`](benchmarks/regexes/wild/date.txt) |
| case-insensitive | `true` |
| unicode | `false` |
| haystack | `2010-03-14` |
| count(`hyperscan`) | 10 |
| count(`.*`) | 5 |

Notice that `regress` is now include in the ASCII benchmark, because in
`compile-unicode` we specifically test that the `\d` used in this regex is
Unicode-aware. `regress` does not make `\d` Unicode-aware, so it gets thrown
into the ASCII group. But do note that it does appear to have some Unicode
awareness.

**compile-unicode**

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| full name | `curated/03-date/compile-unicode` |
| model | [`compile`](MODELS.md#compile) |
| regex-path | [`wild/date.txt`](benchmarks/regexes/wild/date.txt) |
| case-insensitive | `true` |
| unicode | `true` |
| haystack | `۲۰۱۰-۰۳-۱۴` |
| count(`javascript/v8|regress`) | 2 |
| count(`.*`) | 5 |

We use "extended arabic-indic digits" to represent the same date, `2010-03-14`,
that we use for verification in `compile-ascii`. These digits are part of `\d`
when it is Unicode aware.

### ruff-noqa

The regex benchmarked here comes from the [Ruff project][ruff], which is a
Python linter written in Rust. The project uses many regexes, but [we pluck
one out in particular][noqa] that is likely to be run more frequently than the
others:

```
(\s*)((?i:# noqa)(?::\s?(([A-Z]+[0-9]+(?:[,\s]+)?)+))?)
```

This is a regex that looks for `# noqa` annotations on each line. The `noqa`
annotation generally causes the linter to ignore those lines with respect to
warnings it emits. The regex also tries to extract annotations following the
`noqa` that permit ignoring only specific rules in the linter.

This benchmark has a few interesting characteristics worth pointing out:

* It is line oriented, which means the haystacks it searches are likely to be
small. This in turn means that the overhead of the regex engine is likely to
matter more than in throughput oriented benchmarks.
* On this particular haystack (the CPython source code), the number of matches
is quite small. Therefore, it is quite beneficial here to be able to have a
fast path to say "there is no match" without doing any extra work. While the
number of matches here is perhaps uncharacteristically small for a Python
project, you would generally expect _most_ lines to not have `# noqa` in them,
and so the presumption of a fast rejection is probably a decent assumption for
this particular regex.
* Ruff uses capturing groups to pick out parts of the match, so when a match
is found, the regex engine needs to report additional information beyond just
the overall match spans. The spans of each matching capture group also need
to be reported.
* There are no prefix (or suffix) literals in the regex to enable any
straight-forward prefilter optimizations.

With respect to the point about no prefix or suffix literals, we also include
a tweaked version of the regex that removes the leading `(\s*)`:

```
(?i:# noqa)(?::\s?(([A-Z]+[0-9]+(?:[,\s]+)?)+))?
```

In this case, the regex now starts with a literal, albeit one that is asked
to match case insensitively. We can actually see pretty clearly the impact
the tweaked version has on the speed for each regex engine. `pcre2/jit`, for
example, improves its throughput from around 500 MB/s to 1.5 GB/s. `go/regexp`
has an even more dramatic (relatively speaking) improvement.

`rust/regex` is a little different in that it's quite fast in both cases.
The key optimization that applies for `rust/regex` is the "reverse inner"
optimization. Even in the original regex, `rust/regex` will pluck out the `#
noqa` literal and search for it case insensitively. When a candidate is found,
it then searches for `(\s*)` in reverse to find the start position, and then
finally does a standard forward search from that point to find the reverse
position.

### lexer-veryl

This group benchmarks a "lexer" where it combines a whole bunch of different
patterns that identify tokens in a language into a single regex. It then uses
capture groups to determine which branch of the alternation actually matched,
and thus, which token matched. We also benchmark a variant of this that asks
the regex engine to search for each pattern individually (most regex engines
don't support this mode).

This is used by the [Veryl] project by way of the [Parol] parser generator. The
regex was [extracted by the Parol maintainers upon my request][parol-issue].

We use this regex to represent the "lexing" use case, where sometimes folks
will build a pretty big regex with a bunch of small regexes for identifying
tokens. Usually the idea is that the lexer matches literally everything in the
haystack (indeed, the last branch in this regex is a `.` and the first is any
newline), and thus these sorts of regexes tend to be quite latency sensitive.
Namely, it really matters just how much overhead is involved in reporting
matches. This is likely one of the reasons why most regex engines are overall
pretty slow here.

The other aspect of this that's quite difficult is the sheer number of
capturing groups. There's several dozen of them, which means regex engines have
to keep track of a fair bit of state to handle it.

You might think this would be bad for backtrackers and good for automata
engines, since automata engines are *supposed* to be able to handle large
alternations better than backtrackers. But that's not the case here. Even for
example Python's regex engine (backtracker) beats RE2 (automata). My hypothesis
for why this is, is latency. Automata engines tend to have multiple engines
internally and therefore tend to have higher latency, and sometimes multiple
engines run to service one search. Backtrackers tend to have one engine that
handles everything. But still, shouldn't the huge alternation be disastrous for
the backtracker? Perhaps, unless many of the matches occur in an early branch,
which is likely the case here. Namely, the second alternation matches a ` `
(single ASCII space), which is probably the most frequently occurring byte in
the haystack. An automata engine that doesn't use a DFA (which might be the
case here, because the regex is so big), will wind up spending a lot of time
keeping track of all branches of the alternation, even if it doesn't need to
explore all of them. In contrast, a backtracker will try one after the other,
and if most cases match an early branch, the backtracker is likely to take less
overall time.

Most regex engines are stuck in the 1 MB/s (or less) range. The regex crate and
PCRE2's JIT get up to about 10 MB/s, with PCRE2 edging out the regex crate.

Note that the regex was lightly modified from the original to increase
portability across different regex engines. For example, the `[\s--\r\n]` class
was changed to `[\t\v\f ]`.

As for the second benchmark, `multiple`, it uses the same patterns from each
alternation in the `single` benchmark, but treats each one as a distinct
pattern. Doing this requires explicit support for searching multiple regex
patterns. (RE2's and Rust's regex crate "regex set" functionality is not enough
for this, as it only reports which patterns match a haystack, and not where
they match. That's why the lower level `regex/automata/meta` engine is used,
which exposes a more powerful but more complex API.)

In the `multiple` case, the `rust/regex/meta` does very well and the key reason
is the abdication of capture groups as a necessary tool to determine which
token matched. Namely, now we can simply use a pattern ID from the match to
determine which "branch" in the original regex was taken. We no longer need to
ask for or inspect capture groups. This gives a critical benefit to automata
engines that support searching for multiple patterns, because it no longer
requires them to use slower engines for resolving capturing groups.

Note that we don't include Hyperscan here because it doesn't support the
`count-captures` benchmark model. It is included in the `multiple` benchmark
below, which doesn't require capture groups.

Also, I tried to use `dotnet/nobacktrack` here, but it failed because it was

Hyperscan reports everything that matches, including overlapping matches,
and that's why its count is higher. It is likely still serviceable for
this use case, but might in practice require changing the regex to suit
Hyperscan's match semantics. Still, it's a decent barometer to include it here,
particularly because of its multi-regex support.

Most regex engines do not support searching for multiple patterns and finding
the corresponding match offsets, which is why this benchmark has very few
entries.

### cloud-flare-redos

This benchmark uses a regex that helped cause an [outage at
Cloudflare][cloudflare-blog]. This class of vulnerability is typically called a
"regular expression denial of service," or "ReDoS" for short. It doesn't always
require a malicious actor to trigger. Since it can be difficult to reason about
the worst case performance of a regex when using an unbounded backtracking
implementation, it might happen entirely accidentally on valid inputs.

The particular regex that contributed to the outage was:

```
(?:(?:"|'|\]|\}|\\|\d|(?:nan|infinity|true|false|null|undefined|symbol|math)|`|\-|\+)+[)]*;?((?:\s|-|~|!|\{\}|\|\||\+)*.*(?:.*=.*)))
```

As discussed in Cloudflare's post mortem, the specific problematic portion of
the regex is:

```
.*(?:.*=.*)
```

Or more simply:

```
.*.*=.*;
```

We benchmark the original regex along with the simplified variant. We also
split the simplified variant into one with a short haystack (about 100 bytes)
and one with a long haystack (about 10,000 bytes). The benchmark results for
the original and simplified short variant should be roughly similar, but the
difference between the short and long variant is where things get interesting.
The automata based engines generally maintain a similar throughput for both the
short and long benchmarks, but the backtrackers slow way down. This is because
the backtracking algorithm for this specific regex and haystack doesn't scale
linearly with increases in the size of the haystack.

The purpose of this benchmark is to show a real world scenario where the use of
a backtracking engine can bite you in production if you aren't careful.

We include Hyperscan in this benchmark, although it is questionable to do so.
Hyperscan reports many overlapping matches from the regex used by Cloudflare
because of the trailing `.*`, so it is probably not a great comparison.
In particular, this regex was originally used in a firewall, so it seems
likely that it would be used in a "is a match" or "not a match" scenario. But
our benchmark here reproduces the analysis in the appendix of Cloudflare's
port mortem. But the real utility in including Hyperscan here is that it
demonstrates that it is not a backtracking engine. While its throughput is not
as high as some other engines, it remains roughly invariant with respect to
haystack length, just like other automata oriented engines.

Note that `rust/regex` has very high throughput here because the regex is
small enough to get compiled into a full DFA. The compilation process also
"accelerates" some states, particularly the final `.*`. This acceleration works
by noticing that almost all of the state's transitions loop back on itself, and
only a small number transition to another state. The final `.*` for example
only leaves its state if it sees the end of the haystack or a `\n`. So the DFA
will actually run `memchr` on `\n` and skip right to the end of the haystack.

### unicode-character-data

This regex parses data from `UnicodeData.txt`, which is part of the [Unicode
Character Database][ucd]. This regex was [extracted from the `ucd-parse`
crate][ucd-parse-regex], which is part of the [ucd-generate] project.

This benchmark works by iterating over every line in the haystack and then
running the regex on each line. Every line matches the regex, so regex engines
that attempt to do some extra work to reject non-matches quickly will get
penalized. For example, `rust/regex` looks for a semi-colon first via its
"reverse inner" optimization, since a semi-colon is a required part of the
regex. But this optimization is just extra work here. Indeed, disabling it will
improve the thoughput of `rust/regex` on this benchmark.

`pcre2/jit` does remarkably well here, and these types of regexes are one of
the many things that `pcre2/jit` does quickly compared to most other regex
engines.

We also include compilation time for this regex, where PCRE2 again does quite
well.

### words

This benchmark measures how long it takes for a regex engine to find words in
a haystack. We compare one regex that finds all words, `\b\w+\b` and another
regex that only looks for longer words, `\b\w{12,}\b`. We also compare ASCII
regexes on English text with Unicode regexes on Russian text.

The split between finding all words and finding only long words tends to
highlight the overhead of matching in each regex engine. Regex engines that are
quicker to get in and out of its match routine do better at finding all words
than regex engines that have higher overhead. For example, `regress` is faster
than `rust/regex` on `all-english`, but substantially slower than `rust/regex`
on `long-english`. This is likely because `rust/regex` is doing more work per
search call than `regress`, which is in part rooted in the optimizations it
performs to gain higher throughput.

Otherwise, `pcre2/jit` does quite well here across the board, but especially on
the Unicode variants. When comparing it against `rust/regex` for example, it
is substantially faster. In the case of `rust/regex`, its faster DFA oriented
engines cannot handle the Unicode aware `\b` on non-ASCII haystacks, and this
causes `rust/regex` to use a slower internal engine. It's so slow in fact
that `python/re` and `python/regex` are both faster than `rust/regex` for the
Unicode benchmarks. For the ASCII `long-english` benchmark, `rust/regex` and
`re2` both do well because most of the time is spent in its lazy DFA, which has
pretty good throughput performance when compared to a pure backtracker.

Note that several regex engines can't be used in the Unicode variants because
either they don't support a Unicode aware `\w` or because they don't support a
Unicode aware `\b` (or both).

**all-english**

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| full name | `curated/08-words/all-english` |

| count(`icu`) | 56601 |
| count(`.*`) | 56691 |

We specifically write out `[0-9A-Za-z_]` instead of using `\w` because some
regex engines, such as the one found in .NET, make `\w` Unicode aware and there
doesn't appear to be any easy way of disabling it.

Also, the .NET engine makes `\b` Unicode-aware, which also appears impossible
to disable. To account for that, we permit a different count.

**all-russian**

| Parameter | Value |

| count(`java.*`) | 53960 |
| count(`perl`) | 53960 |
| count(`.*`) | 107391 |

`regress`, `re2` and `go/regexp` are excluded because `\w` is not Unicode
aware. `hyperscan` is exclude because it doesn't support a Unicode aware `\b`.

For `dotnet/compiled`, since the length of matching spans is in the number of
UTF-16 code units, its expected count is smaller.

For `perl`, it has the same count as `dotnet/compiled`, but only because it
counts total encoded codepoints. Since every match span in this benchmark
seemingly corresponds to codepoints in the basic multi-lingual plane, it
follows that the number of UTF-16 code units is equivalent to the number of
codepoints.

Also, the fact that `\b` is Unicode-aware in .NET does not seem to impact the

### aws-keys

This [measures a regex][pypi-aws-secrets-regex] for [detecting AWS keys in
source code][pypi-aws-secrets-regex][aws-key-blog]. In particular, to reduce
false positives, it looks for both an access key and a secret key within a few
lines of one another.

We also measure a "quick" version of the regex that is used to find possible
candidates by searching for things that look like an AWS access key.

The measurements here demonstrate why the [pypi-aws-secrets] project splits
this task into two pieces. First it uses the "quick" version to identify
candidates, and then it uses the "full" version to lower the false positive
rate of the "quick" version. The "quick" version of the regex runs around
an order of magnitude faster than the "full" version across the board. To
understand why, let's look at the "quick" regex:

```
((?:ASIA|AKIA|AROA|AIDA)([A-Z0-7]{16}))
```

Given this regex, every match starts with one of `ASIA`, `AKIA`, `AROA` or
`AIDA`. This makes it quite amenable to prefilter optimizations where a regex
engine can look for matches of one of those 4 literals, and only then use the
regex engine to confirm whether there is a match at that position. Some regex
engines will also notice that every match starts with an `A` and use `memchr`
to look for occurrences of `A` as a fast prefilter.

We also include compilation times to give an idea of how long it takes
to compile a moderately complex regex, and how that might vary with the
compilation time of a much simpler version of the regex.

Note that in all of the measurements for this group, we search the CPython
source code (concatenated into one file). We also lossily convert it to UTF-8
so that regex engines like `regress` can participate in this benchmark. (The
CPython source code contains a very small amount of invalid UTF-8.)

### bounded-repeat

This group of benchmarks measures how well regex engines do with bounded
repeats. Bounded repeats are sub-expressions that are permitted to match
up to some fixed number of times. For example, `a{3,5}` matches 3, 4 or 5
consecutive `a` characters. Unlike unbounded repetition operators, the regex
engine needs some way to track when the bound has reached its limit. For this
reason, many regex engines will translate `a{3,5}` to `aaaa?a?`. Given that
the bounds may be much higher than `5` and that the sub-expression may be much
more complicated than a single character, bounded repeats can quickly cause the
underlying matcher to balloon in size.

We measure three different types of bounded repeats:

* A search for a number of consecutive letters, both ASCII only and Unicode
aware.
* A search for certain types of words surrounding a `Result` type in Rust
source code.
* A search for consecutive words, all beginning with a capital letter.

We also include measurements for the compilation time of the last two.

Hyperscan does unusually well here, particularly for an automata oriented
engine. It's plausible that it has some specific optimizations in place for
bounded repeats.

`rust/regex` slows down quite a bit on the `context` regex. Namely, the
`context` regex is quite gnarly and its `(?s:.)` sub-expression coupled with
the bounded repeat causes a large portion of its transition table to get filled
out. This in turn results in more time than usual being spent actually building
the lazy DFA's transition table during a search. Typically, the lazy DFA's
transition table is built pretty quickly and then mostly reused on subsequent
searches. But in this case, the transition table exceeds the lazy DFA's cache
capacity and results in the cache getting cleared. However, the rate at which
new transitions are created is still low enough that the lazy DFA is used
instead of falling back to a slower engine.

### unstructured-to-json

These benchmarks come from a [task that converts unstructured log data to
structured JSON data][OpatrilPeter description]. It works by iterating over
every line in the log file and parsing various parts of each line into
different sections using capture groups. The regex matches every line, so any
fast logic design to reject non-matches will generally penalize regex engines
here.

The original regex looks like this:

```
(?x)
^
(?P<timestamp>[^\ ]+\ [^\ ]+)

[\ ](?P<level>[DIWEF])[1234]:[\ ]

(?P<header>
    (?:
        (?:
            \[ [^\]]*? \] | \( [^\)]*? \)
        ):[\ ]
    )*
)

(?P<body>.*?)

[\ ]\{(?P<location>[^\}]*)\}
$
```

(The actual regex is flattened since not all engines support verbose mode. We
also remove the names from each capture group.)

`pcre2/jit` does _really_ well here. I'm not personally familiar with how
PCRE2's JIT works, but if I had to guess, I'd say there are some clever
optimizations with respect to the `[^ ]+` (and similar) sub-expressions in this
regex.

Otherwise, the backtracking engines generally outperform the automata engines
in this benchmark. Interestingly, all of `re2`, `go/regexp` and `rust/regex`
principally use their own bounded backtracking algorithms. But it looks like
"proper" backtrackers tend to be better optimized than the ones found in RE2
and its descendants. (Bounded backtracking does have to pay for checking that
no combination of haystack position and NFA state is visited more than once,
but even removing that check does not bring, e.g., `rust/regex` up to speeds
similar to other backtrackers.)

### dictionary

This benchmark highlights how well each regex engine does searching for a small
dictionary of words. The dictionary is made up of about 2,500 words, where
every word is at least 15 bytes in length. The number of words was chosen to
be small enough that _most_ regex engines can execute a search in reasonable
time. The bigger minimum length of each word was chosen in order to make this
a throughput benchmark. That is, there is only one match found here, so this
benchmark is measuring the raw speed with which an engine can handle a big
alternation of plain literals.

Most regex engines run quite slowly here. `perl`, `re2` and `rust/regex` lead
the pack with throughput measured in MB/s, while the rest are measured in
KB/s. One might think that this is a benchmark that would manifest as a bright
dividing line between finite automata engines and backtracking engines. Namely,
finite automata engines should handle all of the alternations in "parallel,"
where as backtrackers will essentially try to match each alternate at each
position in the haystack (owch). Indeed, this seems _mostly_ true, but `perl`
(a backtracker) does quite well while `go/regexp` (a finite automata engine)
does quite poorly. Moreover, what explains the differences between `perl`,
`re2` and `rust/regex`?

There are several knots to untangle here.

First, we'll tackle the reason why `go/regexp` has a poor showing here. The
answer lies in how the Thompson NFA construction works. A Thompson NFA can be
built in worst case linear time (in the size of the pattern), but in exchange,
it has _epsilson transitions_ in its state graph. Epsilon transitions are
transitions in a finite state machine that are followed without consuming
any input. In a case like `foo|bar|quux`, you can think of the corresponding
Thompson NFA (very loosely) as creating a single starting state with three
epsilon transitions to each of `foo`, `bar` and `quux`. In a Thompson NFA
simulation (i.e., a regex search using a Thompson NFA), all of these epsilon
transitions have to be continually followed at every position in the haystack.
With a large number of alternations, the amount of time spent shuffling through
these epsilon transitions can be quite enormous. While the search time remains
linear with respect to the size of the haystack, the "constant" factor here
(i.e., the size of the regex pattern) can become quite large. In other words,
a Thompson NFA scales poorly with respect to the size of the pattern. In this
particular case, a Thompson NFA just doesn't do any better than a backtracker.

The second knot to untangle here is why `perl` does so well despite being a
backtracker. While I'm not an expert on Perl internals, it appears to do well
here because of something called a _trie optimization_. That is, Perl's regex
engine will transform large alternations like this into an equivalent but
much more efficient structure by essentially building a trie and encoding it
into the regex itself. It turns out that `rust/regex` does the same thing,
because the exact same optimization helps a backtracker in the same way it
helps a Thompson NFA simulation. The optimization exploits the fact that the
branches in the alternation are not truly independent and actually share a lot
of overlap. Without the optimization, the branches are treated as completely
independent and one must brute force their way through each one.

So what does this trie optimization look like? Consider a regex like
`zapper|z|zap`. There is quite a bit of redundant structure. With some
care, and making sure to preserve leftmost-first match semantics, it can be
translated to the equivalent pattern `z(apper||ap)`. Notice how in the pattern
we started with, the alternation needs to be dealt with for every byte in the
haystack, because you never know which branch is going to match, if any. But in
the latter case, you now don't even need to consider the alternation until the
byte `z` matches, which is likely to be quite rare.

Indeed, the algorithm for constructing such a pattern effectively proceeds by
building a trie from the original alternation, and then converting the trie
back to whatever intermediate representation the regex engine uses.

The last knot to untangle is to explain the differences between `perl`, `re2`
and `rust/regex`. Perl still uses a backtracking strategy, but with the trie
optimization described above, it can try much fewer things for each position
in the haystack. But what's going on with `re2` and `rust/regex`? In this
case, `re2` uses the Thompson NFA simulation, but `re2` does not use the trie
optimization described above, so it gets stuck in a lot epsilon transition
shuffling. Finally, `rust/regex` does the trie optimization _and_ uses its lazy
DFA internally for this case. `re2` probably could too, but both libraries use
various heuristics for deciding which engine to use. In this case, the regex
might be too big for `re2` to use its lazy DFA.

OK, that wraps up discussion of the `single` benchmark. But what is the `multi`
benchmark? Where `single` represents combining all words in the dictionary into
a single pattern, `multi` represents a strategy where each word is treated as
its own distinct pattern. In the `single` case, Hyperscan actually rejects
the pattern for being too large, but is happy to deal with it if each word
is treated as its own pattern. The main semantic difference between these
strategies is that the `multi` approach permits not only identifying where a
match occurred, but *which* word in the dictionary matched. And this is done
without using capture groups.

Hyperscan does really well here. While its source code is difficult penetrate,
my understanding is that Hyperscan uses its "FDR" algorithm here, which is
essentially SIMD-ified variant of multi-substring Shift-Or. This benchmark
represents Hyperscan's bread and butter: multi-pattern search.

`rust/regex` actually does _worse_ in the `multi` case versus the `single`
case. `rust/regex`'s support for multi-pattern search is still young, and in
particular, the multi-pattern case currently inhibits the trie optimization
discussed above.

Finally, we also include compile-time benchmarks for each of the above cases in
order to give an idea of how long it takes to build a regex from a dictionary
like this. I don't have much to say here other than to call out the fact
that the trie optimization does have a meaningful impact on regex compile
times in the `rust/regex` case at least.

### noseyparker

This benchmark measures how well regex engines do when asked to look for
matches for many different patterns. The patterns come from the [Nosey Parker]
project, which finds secrets and sensitive
information in textual data and source repositories. Nosey Parker operates
principally by defining a number of rules for detecting secrets (for example,
AWS API keys), and then looking for matches of those rules in various corpora.
The rules are, as you might have guessed, defined as regular expressions.

I went through each of its rules and extracted a total of 96 regular
expressions, as of [commit `be8c26e8`][be8c26e8]. These 96 regexes make up the
`single` and `multi` benchmarks below, with `single` corresponding to joining
all of patterns into one big alternations and `multi` corresponding to treating
each pattern as its own regex. In the latter case, only the `rust/regex/meta`
and `hyperscan` engines are measured, since they are the only ones to support
multi-regex matching.

This is a particularly brutal benchmark. Most regex engines can't deal with it
at all, and will either reject it at compilation time for being too big or
simple take longer than we're willing to wait. (rebar imposes a reasonable
timeout for all benchmarks, and if the timeout is exceeded, no measurements are
collected.)

Hyperscan is in its own class here. Hyperscan was purpose built to deal with
the multi-pattern use case, and it deals with it *very* well here. The specific
patterns also put this in its wheelhouse because they all have some kind of
literal string in them. Hyperscan uses a [literal searching and finite automata
decomposition strategy][hyperpub] to quickly identify candidate matches and
avoids doing redundant work. Although how it all fits together and avoids
pitfalls such as worst case quadratic search time doesn't appear to be written
down anywhere.

`rust/regex/meta` just barely does serviceably here. It uses its lazy DFA to
handle this regex, but with the default cache sizes, profiling suggests that it
is spending a lot of its time building the DFA. It's plausible that increasing
the cache size for such a big regex would let it execute searches faster.

`pcre2/jit` doesn't do as well here, but one might expect that because it is
a backtracking engine. With that said, no other backtracking engine could deal
with this regex at all, so `pcre2/jit` is doing quite well relative to other
backtracking engines.
