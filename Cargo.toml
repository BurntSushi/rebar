# We don't include regex engines in our workspace because they aren't really
# part of rebar and it would be somewhat unfortunate to need to be able to
# build them in order to work on rebar. So we split them out.
#
# Note that we have a '.vim/coc-settings.json' that overrides rust-analyzer's
# automatic workspace detection because of this. So if a new entry is added to
# this list, then '.vim/coc-settings.json' probably also needs to be updated.
