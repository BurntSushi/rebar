/*!
This module provides some types and routines for grouping benchmarks.
Principally, we provide a way to take a sequence of measurements and group them
by benchmark name, where each group is itself just a map from engine name to
the measurement itself.

This group can then be further and optionally tagged with the actual
corresponding benchmark definition from a TOML file.

This sort of grouping is particularly useful because it reflects the
predominant mode of comparison in rebar. That is, we often was to compare the
relative performance of regex engines on the same benchmark. This grouping is
also the place at which speedup ratios can be computed. When you have many of
these grouping, the speedup ratios can be averaged together via a geometric
mean to get a relative summary statistic comparing regex engines across many
benchmarks.
