Filter by including a benchmark by a name regex pattern.

This flag may be given multiple times and works in concert with the
-F/--filter-not flag. The -f flag introduces a whitelist regex pattern while
-F introduces a blacklist regex pattern. Both combine to form a single filter
with the following rules. First, if there is at least one whitelist pattern,
then a benchmark must match at least one of them in order to be included.
Second, the order of the patterns matters. The last pattern that matches a
benchmark wins. For example, if '-f curated -F ruff' is given, then even though
the first pattern matches 'curated/04-ruff', since '-F ruff' came after and
is a blacklist pattern, 'curated/04-ruff' benchmarks will be excluded. Third,
regardless of how many whitelist patterns there are, a benchmark is only
included if the last pattern it matches is not a blacklist pattern.

Filter regexes are matched on the full name of the benchmark, which takes the
form '{group}/{name}'. Regexes use unanchored search. So to match the full
name, use, e.g., '^test/func/dollar-only-matches-end$'.

    // We define some simpler and common flag usages right here directly.

    pub const BENCH_DIR: Usage = Usage::new(
        "-d, --dir <directory>",
        "The directory containing bench definitions",
        r#"
The directory containing benchmark definitions, haystacks and regexes.

This flag specifies the directory that contains both the benchmark definitions
and the haystacks. The benchmark definitions must be in files with a '.toml'
extension. All haystacks should be in '{{dir}}/haystacks/' and have a '.txt'
extension. Both benchmark definitions and haystacks may be in sub-directories.

The default for this value is 'benchmarks'.

    );

    pub const MAX_ITERS: Usage = Usage::new(
        "--max-iters <number>",
        "The max number of iterations to run.",
        r#"
The maximum number of iterations to run for each benchmark.

One of the difficulties of a benchmark harness is determining just how long to
run a benchmark for. We want to run it long enough that we get a decent sample,
but not too long that we are waiting forever for results. That is, there is a
point of diminishing returns.

This flag permits controlling the maximum number of iterations that a benchmark
will be executed for. In general, one should not need to change this, as it
would be better to tweak --max-time instead. However, it is exposed in case
it's useful, and in particular, you might want to increase it in certain
circumstances for an usually fast routine.
"#,
    );

    pub const MAX_WARMUP_ITERS: Usage = Usage::new(
        "--max-warmup-iters <number>",
        "The max number of warm-up iterations to run.",
        r#"
This is like --max-iters, but it applies to the number of iterations to run the
benchmark for "warm up."

Warm up refers to the part of the benchmark where it is executed and verified,
but timing samples are not collected. Warm up is used as an attempt to capture
timings that reflect average real world behavior.
"#,
    );

    pub const MAX_TIME: Usage = Usage::new(
        "--max-time <duration>",
        "The max time to run each benchmark.",
        r#"
The approximate amount of time to run a benchmark.

This harness tries to balance "benchmarks taking too long" and "benchmarks need
enough samples to be reliable" by varying the number of times each benchmark is
executed. Slower search routines (for example) get executed fewer times while
faster routines get executed more. This is done by holding invariant roughly
how long one wants each benchmark to run for. This flag sets that time.

In general, unless a benchmark is unusually fast, one should generally expect
each benchmark to take roughly this amount of time to complete.

The format for this flag is a duration specified in seconds, milliseconds,
microseconds or nanoseconds. Namely, '^[0-9]+(s|ms|us|ns)$'.
"#,
    );

    pub const MAX_WARMUP_TIME: Usage = Usage::new(
        "--max-warmup-time <duration>",
        "The max time to warm up each benchmark.",
        r#"
The approximate amount of time to warmup a benchmark.

This is like --max-time, but it controls the maximum amount of time to spending
"warming" up a benchmark. The idea of warming up a benchmark is to execute the
thing we're trying to measure for a period of time before starting the process
of collecting samples. The reason for doing this is generally to fill up any
internal caches being used to avoid extreme outliers, and even to an extent,
to give CPUs a chance to adjust their clock speeds up. The idea here is that a
"warmed" regex engine is more in line with real world use cases.

As a general rule of thumb, warmup time should be one half the benchmark time.
Indeed, if this is not given, it automatically defaults to half the benchmark
time.
