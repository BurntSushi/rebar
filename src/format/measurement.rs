When this flag is set, benchmarks that do not include all regex engines will
be excluded from the report. The set of all regex engines is determined by
unioning the sets of all measurements given to this command.

This is applied after the various filters. So for example, one could pass a
filter like `-e '^(rust/regex|hyperscan)$'` to limit a comparison to only those
two regex engines. That is, only benchmarks containing measurements for both
'rust/regex' and 'hyperscan' will be included.
